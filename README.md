I love reading! This is a project I made to demonstrate data cleaning, querying, and visualization with Excel, SQL; PowerBI.
### **Executive Summary:**
This project explores the trends in book genres over time using **SQL** and **Power BI**. I pulled book genre data from the database, cleaned, modified, and analyzed it, and then created a dashboard to visualize how genre popularity has changed over the years. After identifying key trends, such as the steady rise of Science Fiction and Fantasy genres and the decline in popularity of Romance, I offer insights on how publishers and authors can adapt to these changes to cater to reader preferences.

**Key Findings & Recommendations**:
- **Key Genres Growing**: Science Fiction and Fantasy have shown consistent growth, suggesting that publishers should increase their focus on these genres.
- **Declining Genres**: Romance and Historical Fiction have seen a decrease in popularity. Publishers may need to reconsider their approach to promoting these genres or introduce sub-genres to attract new readers.
- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - Focus on emerging trends within popular genre. 
  - Develop targeted marketing strategies for declining genres to reignite interest, possibly by connecting with new, relevant audiences.

### **Business Problem:**
Publishing companies and authors need to understand changing reader preferences to optimize their book releases and marketing strategies. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify which genres are increasing or decreasing in popularity over time. How can publishers adjust their strategies to maximize sales and engagement in an ever-changing literary market?

### **Methodology:**
1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Used Python in Excel and a sequence of SQL queries to extract, clean, and transform the dataset containing book genres, publication years, and sales.
2. **Visualization**: Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize the trends in genre popularity over the years, highlighting key periods of growth and decline, adding optional tools to filter based on genre, year, and demographic.

#### **Key Steps**:
+ **Excel**:
Cleaned the dataset to standardize genre names and authors, eliminate inaccurate ajd incomplete data manually with Excel.
+ **SQL**:
Used **CRUD** operations, **CTEs** **JOINs** and **aggregate functions** to calculate required metrics
+ **Power BI**:
Created a visually engaging dashboard showing genre trends over time using **DAX functions**, calculated columns, and **data modeling**.

### **Skills**:
+ **EXCEL**: Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation
+ **SQL**: Proficiency with joins, CTEs, aggregate functions, and data transformation.
+ **Power BI**: Expertise in DAX, data visualization, ETL, and dashboard creation.


### **Results & Business Recommendation:**
The Power BI dashboard provides stakeholders with clear insights into genre trends across decades, helping publishers decide where to invest resources for future book releases. Here's what the data showed:

**Popular Genres**: Genres like Romance and Fantasy have consistently grown, indicating a strong, sustained interest. Publishers should capitalize on this by releasing more books in these genres or focusing on niche sub-genres.
**Declining Genres**: Thrilller, crime, and historical Fiction have seen declining sales over time. A potential solution for publishers is to introduce new sub-genres, perhaps mixing historical with other popular genres like Fantasy to create a sort of hybrid-genre that entices loyal/eager readers.

### **Key Product Adjustments**:
2. **Targeted Campaigns for Declining Genres**: Introduce fresh sub-genres or rebrand older ones to spark renewed interest in declining genres.
3. **Cross-Genre Experimentation**: Encourage intermediate authors to collaborate with Penguin, Random House, and Amazon Digital Services

### **Next Steps**:
2. **Collaborate with Authors**: Work closely with novice and excellent rated authors to create content that aligns with current genre trends while incorporating elements from declining genres.
3. **Track and Measure Success**: Use Power BI to monitor changes in genre and publisher popularity and evaluate the success of marketing efforts and product adjustments over time.

By staying ahead of genre trends and making strategic adjustments, publishers can optimize sales while better meeting the evolving tastes of readers.
