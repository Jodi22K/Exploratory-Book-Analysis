    "## **Executive Summary:**\n",
    "This project analyzes the trends in book genres over time using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. By pulling book genre data from a database, cleaning it, and visualizing the results, we identify key patterns in genre popularity. Notable findings include the consistent growth of Self-Help, Romance, and Fantasy genres and a decline in Mystery and Historical Fiction. The project provides actionable recommendations for publishers to adjust their strategies and optimize sales based on evolving reader preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Business Problem:**\n",
    "Publishing companies and authors need insights into changing reader preferences to make informed decisions on book releases and marketing strategies. The objective of this analysis is to identify which genres are rising or declining in popularity over time and suggest how publishers can adapt their approaches to maximize engagement and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology:**\n",
    "### 1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - **Excel**: Loaded and cleaned the dataset (Books_Data_Clean.xls) by standardizing genre names and eliminating incomplete or inconsistent data - 1st deleted row duplicates, corrected entries encoded incorrectly, deleted irrelevant columns, and filled rows with blank data containing the correct book specified for each row (these were researched and carefully evaluated guesses utilizing the information given, but if there was more than 1 book that mapped on to the data accurately, the row was deleted)\n",
